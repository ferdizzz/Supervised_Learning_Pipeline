## Developing a supervised learning pipeline
The CNR institute has outsourced the challenge of finding an explainable supervised learning model to infer the unknown hidden function from the available dataset. The dataset contains 150 different observations related to the power radiated by a black body, with anonymized features such as temperature, pressure, etc. My task involves implementing a machine learning pipeline using an appropriate programming language, like Python, and providing a report with the following sections:

* Loading data and preliminary analysis: Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand the data's structure, characteristics, and potential correlations between variables. Use descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to better comprehend the dataset.

* Training and testing a machine learning pipeline: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a supervised learning model on the training set and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics on the testing set. I can choose to use regression or classification models based on the nature of the outcome variable.

* Tuning the proposed machine learning pipeline: Fine-tune the chosen model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search. Re-train the model using the optimal hyperparameters and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

* Model interpretation: Analyze the importance of each feature in the trained model to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the outcome variable. If possible, provide a clear explanation for the model's predictions to make it more understandable for the CNR institute.

* Discussion: Discuss the pros and cons of the designed pipeline, addressing any limitations or potential improvements. Analyze the time complexity of the pipeline, considering factors such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
